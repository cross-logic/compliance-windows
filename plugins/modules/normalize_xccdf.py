module: normalize_xccdf
short_description: Normalize XCCDF results to common compliance findings format
description:
  - Parses XCCDF result XML files produced by DISA SCC, OpenSCAP, or any
    SCAP 1.2/1.3 compliant scanner.
  - Transforms each rule-result into the common findings JSON format.
  - Aggregates results across multiple hosts.
  - Output is the scanner-agnostic format consumed by the compliance API.
  - Shared logic lives in module_utils/normalize_common.py.
